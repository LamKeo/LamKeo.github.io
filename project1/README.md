##Project 1 Rochambo

####This is a simple oldschool game of ROCHAMBO. The user chooses their weapon and enters it into the input box and clicks submit or hits enter. They will then see if they won or not with a returned phrase of if their weapon harmed their opponent or not.

####It's not an elaborate interactive game or site. But I utilized what I know and tried to incorporate smalls things that I am building confidence over. Such as, Javascript, HTML, CSS, event listeners, etc.

####I wanted a simple design to begin with. In my mind I wanted something elaborate and impressive but I also realized I should tackle small challenges and then grow from there. So I decided on something basic to get comfortable with understanding how those things work.

####Trying to think my way around the logic was challenging as it was a challenge to begin with. I think this project is helping me to become more familiar with how the problems are presented. It's a slow yet challenging process. I struggled with wanting to add more and more features but am limited in time.

####CSS was most challenging since some features that I wanted to add would affect all the work I had put into making the logic work for now. I had to choose between aesthetics or functionality. Overall, even though there is so much work to be done, I'm happy with the small triumphs and knowledge that was gained.
